							<p>Recycling Hive is an idea born from a local Facebook community – filled with recycling
								heroes!</p>
							<p>
								Any of us that care about the environment and sustainability know that recycling is NOT
								the first answer: Rethink, repair, refuse, repurpose, reduce, re-use, recycle.
								But, it is still an important step in trying to undo the damage we have already done and
								avoid further damage to our planet.
								But recycling isn't always that easy.</p>
							<p>

								Most local authorities still have a long way to go with regards to what they accept, and
								there are a lot of rules which must be adhered to if you want to be sure the contents of your recycling
								bin doesn’t end up going to landfill because of contamination. <em>Should lids be left on plastic bottles? Depends where you live!</em></p>
							<p>

								Local recycling communities can be a godsend, thanks to caring individuals who collect various recyclables and send them in the right direction -
								charities, Terracycle, additional council-run facilities and even repurposing (to name a
								few).</p>
							<p>
								But working out what goes where can be the tricky part! Our local group ended up
								with a very unwieldy spreadsheet (frequently updated by some amazing volunteers). The
								problem was, scanning through the spreadsheet became a time-consuming job, and keeping
								it up-to-date as people started new collections or stopped old collections was a
								minefield.</p>
							<p>

								This is where Recycling Hive comes in!</p>
							<p>

								I (Jess Bennett) wanted to find a way to pay back my lovely recycling community for all
								their hard work – and as a new software development student, the idea for this site came
								about.</p>
							<p>

								In its initial stages, it will just serve our local community – but the hope for the
								future is that the site can be adopted by other local hives across the UK!</p>

							<p>Your Hive is made up of several different community members:</p>
							<p><strong>Queen Bees</strong> – Your Hive will have one or more (up to a maximum of four)
								queen bees. Yes,
								too many queen bees for your typical hive, perhaps – but this is about spreading the
								workload! Our bees also have jobs, families and hobbies to attend to.
								The role of the Queen Bee is to accept new membership requests, and approve new
								recycling locations. They will have decided on what criteria is needed before accepting
								a new member - local addresses are displayed on the site, so they might have some questions
                                to check that you really <strong>are</strong> local before being
								accepted!</p>
							<p><strong>Worker Bees</strong> – There will (hopefully) be many, many workers in your hive.
								These are the
								local heroes who happily accept your recycling and send it off to the right place. They
								work incredibly hard and may well fall into the Queen Bee <strong>and</strong> Busy Bee category!</p>
							<p><strong>Busy Bees</strong> – That’s most of us here! Busy bees are vital for this
								community effort. They collect all their recyclables, keep them clean and organised (and
								follow the notes given by the Worker Bees, to the letter!),
								before delivering them to the Worker Bees for dispatch!

							</p>
							<p>If you're really not liking how it works, then <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}" class="internal-link">let me
									have your suggestions</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>
							<p>In the meantime, here are a few pointers:</p>
							<p><strong>How do I find an item to recycle?</strong><br>
                            Head to the <a href="{{ url_for('get_recycling_categories') }}" class="internal-link">Hive</a>
								and get browsing! You can look by category (e.g. Food/drink packaging) or item (e.g.
								Crisp packets) and then see who is collecting
								that item in your area. Can't find what you're looking for? Sounds like no-one in your
								Hive is collecting it. Why don't you start a collection?
							</p>
							<p><strong>What else can I drop off to a Worker Bee?</strong><br>
                            If you're already on your way to drop off some recycling, why not make the journey even more worthwhile and see what else you could be taking there?<br>
                            Once you're in the <a href="{{ url_for('get_recycling_categories') }}"
									class="internal-link">Hive</a>, just go to <a
									href="{{ url_for('get_recycling_members', member_type='view-all') }}"
									class="internal-link">Hive Members</a> and click on a name to see all the items they currently accept.
							</p>
                            <p><strong>How do I add a collection?</strong><br>
                            When you first join the site, you are automatically a 'Busy Bee'. To become a 'Worker Bee', you just need to add your first collection from your 
                            <a href="{{ url_for('profile', username=session['username']) }}" class="internal-link">Profile Page</a>. Once that's been approved by a Queen Bee, you're free to add as many collections
                            as you want, without waiting for further approval.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>What if I don't want to put my address on here?</strong><br>
                            The registration process has been designed to encourage only local people to join and your address will only be visible to those that have registered to be 
                            part of your local community. However, it is a website and it's understandable if you don't feel comfortable
                            sharing your address here.<br>
                            If this is the case, then you can put what you want in the address fields (although they do all need to be filled in). For example, you could put:<br>
                            <strong>Street:</strong> Please call/text on 07123 456 789 for collection address.<br>
                            <strong>Town:</strong> Newbury<br>
                            <strong>Postcode:</strong> XXX XXX<br>
